# CalendarProject
Here is the solve of the Meeting Calendar problem, from the PDF.

Note: when you will put an input, make sure that it is correct write. In example from PDF, at the booked Calendar 2, at 15:00 it's missed the " ' " from the finalTime
(before "]").

To run the project with another inputs, you can modify the 4 input string;
You could put any types of time, not only from 30 in 30 min.
The meeting time also could be initiate with any valid value.
